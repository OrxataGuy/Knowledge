# ReCaptcha v3
## Step 1
We access the [Google console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/security/recaptcha) and create a new project or select an existing one.

## Step 2
We create a key, entering a visible name to identify it, choosing the platform on which it will be used (in this case "website") and adding the domains on which the reCaptcha will be used. We can configure the reCaptcha in the way that suits us best.

## Step 3
We store the `key` token and the `secret` key, and add the `.html` code to the frontend, and the `.php` code to the backend.
